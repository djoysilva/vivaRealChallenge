#**What is this repository for?**#
API to study and to VivaReal challenge. - Creating and searching Properties
version 2.0

# **How do I get set up?** #

I still don't have experience with json or Spring, so I chose to make all the challenges with the native way and with my logic, making the mvp working well.

API created with Java and jsp using Eclipse, so you just need install the Tomcat8 (you can get this in the folder vivaReal2.0/lib)

Tutorial in portuguese for TomCat8 configuration: http://www.devmedia.com.br/instalacao-e-configuracao-do-apache-tomcat-no-eclipse/27360

url to access the API: http://localhost/vivaReal2.0/createProperty.jsp

To run tests you need to access vivaReal/src/br/com/vivaReal/test
