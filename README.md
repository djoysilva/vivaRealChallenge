API to VivaReal challenge. - Creating and searching Properties
version 1

# **How do I get set up?** #
API created with Java Project using Eclipse, so you just need the Eclipse IDE
 
no Database configuration

To run tests you need to access vivaReal/src/br/com/vivaReal/test

I still don't have experience with json or Spring, so I chose to make all the challenges with the native way and with my logic, making the mvp working well.
