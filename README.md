API to VivaReal challenge. - Creating and searching Properties
version 1 and version 2.0

# version 1** #
# **How do I get set up?** #
API created with Java Project using Eclipse, so you just need the Eclipse IDE
 
no Database configuration

To run tests you need to access vivaReal/src/br/com/vivaReal/test

I still don't have experience with json or Spring, so I chose to make all the challenges with the native way and with my logic, making the mvp working well.

# version 2.0** #
# **How do I get set up?** #
(In this moment, I am changing the version 2.0 with tests using junit to study)

Creating API, to study, with Java and jsp using Eclipse, so you just need install the Tomcat8 (you can get this in the folder vivaReal2.0/lib)
